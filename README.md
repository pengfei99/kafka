# kafka

Apache Kafka has been gaining so much popularity these past few years due to its **highly scalable, robust, and fault-tolerant publish-subscribe architecture**. It is one of the fastest-growing open-source projects, which was initially developed by LinkedIn in 2010 and is now being used by thousands of organizations. If you are interested in learning about Kafka architecture, I’d highly recommend reading `Kafka: The Definitive Guide`. If you need additional motivation to get into Kafka, I’d recommend reading these case studies done by The [New York Times](https://www.confluent.io/blog/publishing-apache-kafka-new-york-times/) and Netflix(https://netflixtechblog.com/evolution-of-the-netflix-data-pipeline-da246ca36905).

In this project, we will learn what is Kafka, then how to use it to resolve real world example.
